# Algoim
### Algorithms for implicitly defined geometry, level set methods, and Voronoi implicit interface methods.

## Modifications

This folk is a slightly modified version of Saye's original library.  The two main additions are as follows:

1. We differentiated `algoim/quadrature_multipoly.hpp` and its dependencies using [cppduals](https://tesch1.gitlab.io/cppduals/index.html), except for those
   parts that rely on LAPACK routines.  For the LAPACK routines we had to do some old-fashioned "hand-differentiation."  cppduals
   is a header-only library, and it is included directly as `algoim/dual.hpp`.
3. We added `algoim/cutquad.hpp` and `algoim/cutquad.cpp` in order to faciliate wrapping the quadrature routines
   in Julia.

These additions/changes were only applied to the quadrature routines for domains implicitly-defined by multivariate polynomials.
